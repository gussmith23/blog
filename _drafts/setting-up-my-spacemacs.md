Set log mode on in the agenda: `org-agenda-start-with-log-mode`.
Describe how I use logging---or maybe do that in some other post about my workflow?

[Install Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).
Just follow those instructions.
The only difference I'd add is to checkout the `develop` branch once you checkout the `.emacs.d` directory.
I find `develop` (perhaps counterintuitively) to be more stable; I'm fairly certain this is understood to be true in the Spacemacs community.

I also needed to update my emacs install on Debian 9:
```bash
sudo apt-get install emacs25
```
