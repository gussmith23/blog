When I get to work:
- Create a journal entry for the day e.g. `2019-1-4.org`. I keep these all in a `journal` folder, which is pointed to by my `org-agenda-files` variable.
- Check Google reminders and add them to my org-mode. 
- Check Google calendar and add them to my org-mode for the day.

To add something to my org-mode for the day, I do one of two things:
- if it's just a task, I add it as a top-level `TODO` in my journal entry for the day and `org-schedule` it to today's date (and possibly to a specific time, if I'm really trying to plan my day out)
- if it's a meeting, I add it as a top-level heading, and `org-time-stamp` it. `org-mode` note: this produces an active timestamp (which means it appears in the agenda, which is exactly what I want). There is an `org-time-stamp-inactive` version as well.

After that, I brainstorm what I want to get done.
Setting goals deserves its own section, but the core thing I've realized is this: I need to set goals which are achievable for that day.
I am trying to make it less and less acceptable for me to not finish almost every goal on the list.
I think there's something to be said for always setting optimistic about how much you can get done.
I'm not sure _what_ exactly is to be said, but I'm sure there's something, and something positive at that.
But if you can always set a perfectly-overly-optimistic goal (i.e. I always leave one task incomplete by the end of the day) then I'm just as good at budgeting time and estimating workload as in the case where I set a perfect goal every day.
